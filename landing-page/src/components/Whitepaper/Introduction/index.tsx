          <p>
            There are many game titles and projects using blockchain technology
            on the mainnet, including Ethereum, etc. However, only a few big
            titles that fit into trends such as the metaverse, NFT, or Play to
            Earn are getting the limelight. However, not all game developers develop AAA titles and not all
            users immerse themselves only in such big titles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Coinica</b> is a project that aims to create a platform based on the
            DAO, where users can participate in titles that they have tested and
            found interesting, including games that implement simple play ideas,
            and where developers can make a profit so that they can continue to
            operate and develop more titles. We are planning to build such a
            platform based on DAO.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it is difficult to create such a platform all at once, so
            we need to develop a number of titles with our original team to
            attract and maintain the interest of game users in <b>Coinica</b> platform,
            and to make other game developers want to participate in our
            platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we will also work to build a decentralized DAO
            system that allows game users to participate in the platform and be
            involved in the management of the platform and games at an early
            stage, rather than having a centralized team that develops games and
            selects games that want to participate and make it a business to
            participate in the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our focus is to create an environment where people who like games
            and are interested in our plans can easily voice their opinions,
            rate games, vote for their favorite games, and provide an open
            environment for game developers to submit their games to the
            platform. The goal is to create an environment where a wide variety
            of games, including casual games, can be played.
          </p>
          <p>We wish the <b>Coinica</b> platform will be loved by many people.</p>
